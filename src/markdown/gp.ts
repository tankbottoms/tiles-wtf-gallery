## Introduction.

These guiding principles constitute an Agreement (hereinafter the "Agreement") and are entered into by and amongst members of Infinite Tiles v2 DAO (hereinafter “DAO”), an unincorporated nonprofit association organized under the laws of the State of Delaware.

The following terms apply when you click to view or access DAO's Dapp, DAO's online services (including https://tiles.wtf), or any other of DAO's sites, donate or transfer cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, or transfer one or more ERC-20 ("Tokens") or ERC-721 ("NFTs") or other digital assets (collectively, "Cryptographic currencies") to the DAO, become a Member of DAO, receive DAO Governance Tokens, hold Governance Rights for the DAO, interact with or access [the DAO's smart contracts](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000) in any way, provide services to the DAO, donate or transfer any property to the DAO, or otherwise interact with or access any other of the DAO's services. The DAO's governance may occur on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org), however for the purpose of this agreement we refer to this as part of the DAO Dapp.

**By doing any of the above, you signify your agreement to these terms. If you do not agree to be bound by the Agreement in its entirety, you may not access, interact with, or use the DAO Dapp or online services.**

Capitalized terms used herein have the meanings ascribed to them in the Definitions.

---

## 1. Organization.

**(a) Formation.** The DAO was formed on _August 15, 2022._ The obligations of members of the DAO shall be determined pursuant to the Delaware Uniform Unincorporated Nonprofit Association Act, Del. Code Ann. Tit. 6, §§ 1901-1916 inclusive (the "Act"), and this Agreement.

**(b) Purpose.** The primary purpose of the DAO is to generate Infinite Tiles.

The DAO is an unincorporated association of individuals, corporations, statutory trusts, business trusts, estates, trusts, partnerships, limited liability companies, associations, joint ventures, or any other legal or commercial entities, many of whom, if not all of whom, agree to join together for a common, nonprofit purpose. For the DAO, that purpose is encapsulated in its mission statement.

The DAO is not intended to be or become an entity required to register as an “investment company” as defined in Section3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

## 2. Membership; Governance Rights and Tokens; Limitations.

**(a) Governance Rights.** Governance Rights in the DAO are represented by Project Tokens, with each Token representing a fractional part of the Governance Rights of all Members (or assignees, as the case may be) equal to the quotient of one (1) divided by the total number of Tokens claimed at any time. Member's Governance Rights are subject to DAO Governance.  Any individual who has minted a Infinite Tile v2 NFT is also a member of the DAO.

**(b) Tokens.** As of the date hereof, there shall be an allowance of up to the max of an unsigned integer 2(<sup>256-1</sup>)[^1] tokens authorized to represent membership interests in the DAO, unless otherwise agreed to by the Members via a vote occurring through the Dapp. Membership in the DAO, as defined by Del. Code Ann. Tit. 6, § 1901, shall be voluntary and open to any individual whose purpose or presumed intent is to contribute to the DAO and is willing to accept responsibilities and terms of membership. The DAO shall grant the initial Member's governance voting tokens proportional to contributions to the DAO's Gnosis multi-signature wallet[^2].

Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, the DAO may provide initial members Tokens for their role in conceiving and supporting the DAO.

**(c) Limitation to the DAO Protocol Configuration.** The DAO shall not configure its Juicebox Treasury with an undefined Reserved Rate, a Reserved Rate of 0%, a Redemption Rate of 100%, or a Discount Rate other than 0%. **The DAO shall not configure its Juicebox Treasury with any parameters that would cause the capital value of Token Redemptions via the Redemption Rate to exceed the cost basis required to issue those Tokens from the DAO's Juicebox Treasury.**

**(d) Admission.** The DAO is a decentralized network of members and may admit or deny individuals for any arbitrary purpose or lack of purpose.

> **(i) Initialization.** On August 15, 2022, the DAO will initialize its membership with _0x8a97426C1a720a45B8d69E974631f01f1168232B_ or _cptspacecadet.eth_ as the initial member.

## 3. Liability.

**(a) No Member Liability.** Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or the Act, no Member (or former Member) shall be personally liable for the obligations of the DAO, including any obligations owed by any such Member in connection with any breach of this Agreement. A debt, obligation, or other liability of the DAO is solely the debt, obligation, or other liability of the DAO. Members (or former Members) are not personally liable, directly or indirectly, by way of contribution or otherwise, for a debt, obligation, or other liability of the DAO solely by reason of being or acting as a Member or acting on behalf of the DAO. The failure of the DAO to observe formalities relating to the exercise of its powers or management of its activities and affairs is not grounds for imposing liability on a Member of the DAO for a debt, obligation, or other liability of the DAO.

**(b) Member Limitations.** No Member shall have the right or power:

> **(i)** to cause the dissolution and winding up of the DAO; or
>
> **(ii)** to demand or receive property, including any Cryptographic Currency or ERC-20 or ERC-721 Tokens ("Cryptocurrency assets") donated or otherwise transferred to the DAO, except as agreed to by the Members or otherwise provided herein.

## 4. Admission of Additional Members.

**(a)** Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the Members are authorized to accept additional donations from one or more Members, and to admit other Persons to the DAO as additional Members (each such additional Member and such existing Member is an "Additional Member"). Unless otherwise determined by the Members, any such Additional Members shall be admitted to the DAO only if such Member or Additional Member makes a donation via the Dapp.

**(b) Accession to Agreement.** Each Person who is to be admitted as an Additional Member pursuant to this Agreement shall agree to be bound by all of the terms of this Agreement as if they were a member from the inception of the DAO.

## 5. Management.

**(a)** Except as otherwise expressly required in this Agreement, the affairs of the DAO shall be carried on and managed exclusively by the Members, who shall have sole and absolute discretion with respect thereto. No Member shall be a manager, as defined under the Act.

**(b)** Whenever any action, including any approval, consent, decision, determination, or resolution is to be taken or given by the Members or the DAO under this Agreement or under the Act, it shall be authorized by a vote of the Members via the Dapp or the DAO's Snapshot Spaces, unless otherwise provided herein. Such an authorization may be evidenced by a vote facilitated via the Dapp or the DAO's Snapshot Spaces and one or more smart contracts, or by a written consent, in accordance with this Agreement. The Members intend that any action (which has been duly approved in accordance with this Agreement) taken by the DAO via a Dapp, a smart contract, or the blockchain shall be a valid action of the Members or the DAO, as applicable, and no Member shall challenge the authority or validity of any such action based solely on such fact.

**(c)** Except as otherwise expressly required in this Agreement or in the Act, no single Member (in their capacity as a Member) shall have authority to bind the DAO in any way or to enter into any agreement or contract obligating the DAO in any way unless approved via a vote occurring through the Dapp.

**(d)** To the extent that the Members have approved a document in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Act, any Member can be expressly hereby authorized to execute and deliver such document on behalf of the DAO.

**(e)** Members may appoint a proxy to vote or otherwise act for the Member with regards to the DAO pursuant to the Dapp.

**(f)** The DAO has the right to delegate certain technical or administrative responsibilities to third parties and provide them with reasonable compensation.

**(g)** Reliance by Third Parties. Persons dealing with the DAO are entitled to rely conclusively upon the power and authority of the Members (and any Person to whom the Members delegated any such power and authority pursuant to this Agreement) and acknowledge that such Member or designee is authorized to act on behalf of the DAO and may bind the DAO or otherwise enter into a binding contract.

**(h) Other Activities.** Each Member acknowledges and agrees that in addition to transactions specifically contemplated by this Agreement, and subject to applicable law, the Members, the DAO, and their respective Affiliates and Representatives are each hereby authorized to obtain property or obtain services from, to provide property or provide services to, or otherwise enter into any transaction with any Member, or any Affiliate or Representative of any of the foregoing Persons.

## 6. Withdrawal Rights; Compulsory Withdrawal; Non-Disparagement.

**(a) Limited Right to Withdraw.** A Member may withdraw at any time by transferring its Tokens to a third party. Such withdrawal shall be facilitated and executed, in part, using one or more smart contracts and shall be effective as of the date of transfer. Any withdrawal is irrevocable. Alternatively, a Member may redeem the entirety of the Tokens held, which are submitted to the Juicebox Protocol and burned, thereby reducing the total DAO Token supply. In return the Member receives some portion of their initial or cumulative DAO Membership holdings in Ethereum (or other Cryptographic Currency). A Member who burns the entirety of their token holdings shall be deemed to have withdrawn from the DAO. The DAO shall not be obligated to pay any interest or other compensation to a Member who redeems or withdraws its Tokens.

**(b) Compulsory Withdrawal.** Not in limitation of Section 6(a), the Members acting by vote via the Dapp may cause a Member to be compulsorily withdrawn from the DAO to the extent that such Members, in their reasonable discretion, determine it to be necessary, desirable, or appropriate, including, without limitation, to comply with applicable law or regulations, or to avoid a material adverse effect on the DAO or the other Members. For the avoidance of doubt–the Member proposed to be compulsorily withdrawn shall be entitled to vote with respect to any vote of the Members regarding such compulsory withdrawal.

**(c) Emergency Immediate Compulsory Withdrawal For Cause.** Not in limitation of Section 6(a), 6(b), the Service Provider, in their reasonable discretion, determine it to be necessary, desirable, or appropriate, including, without limitation, to comply with applicable law or regulations, or to avoid a material adverse effect on the DAO or the other Members may be withdrawn without further notice or vote of the Members. For the avoidance of doubt–the Member to be compulsorily withdrawn shall be entitled to vote with respect to any vote of the Members regarding such compulsory withdrawal, unless the Member is deemed to be in violation of the Code of Conduct and Community Enforcement Guidelines.

**(d) Non-Disparagement** During the term of the DAO Membership, and thereafter, the Member shall not make any disparaging remarks, or any remarks that could reasonably be construed as disparaging, regarding the DAO, its or their Members, or its affiliates, or agents. The DAO shall, except to the extent otherwise required by applicable laws, rules, or regulations or as appropriate in the exercise of the Community Enforcement Guidelines exercise reasonable efforts to cause the following individual(s) to refrain from making any disparaging statements, orally or in writing, regarding the DAO, its Members, or agents from and after the Membership period. Not in limitation of Section 6(a), 6(b), 6(c) and 6(d).

## 9. Dissolution.

**(a) General.** The DAO shall be dissolved and its affairs shall be wound up upon the earliest to occur of:

> **(i)** a determination of the Members by Majority Vote; or
>
> **(ii)** the entry of a decree of judicial dissolution pursuant to the Act.

Any such assets not so disposed of shall be disposed of by a court of competent jurisdiction of the county in which the principal office of the corporation is then located, exclusively for such purposes or to such organization or organizations, as said Court shall determine, which are organized and operated exclusively for such purposes.

## 10. Limitations on Transfers.

**(a) Transfers.** Governance Rights and Tokens are not transferable, except to other members. Members may vote to allow or disallow the ability of Members to transfer their Governance Rights and/or Tokens by a vote facilitated via the Dapp. Tokens may become freely transferable to Ethereum addresses outside of the DAO ("External Addresses") by a vote of the Members. In the event the Tokens become freely transferable to External Addresses, you agree that holders of External Address which Tokens are transferred to shall automatically be granted Membership rights, subject to this Agreement.

**(b) Admission of Substituted Members.** If the transferee is not already a Member, any transferee of Tokens transferred in accordance with the provisions of this Section shall be admitted as a Member. The DAO shall not recognize for any purpose any purported transfer of all or any part of a Member's interest or Tokens in the DAO, and no purchaser, assignee, transferee, or other recipient of all or any part of such Tokens shall become a Member hereunder unless:

> **(i)** The transferee of Tokens transferred pursuant to this Section that is admitted to the DAO as a transferee Member shall succeed to the rights and liabilities of the transferor Member with respect to such transferred Tokens.
>
> **(ii)** Effect of Death, Dissolution, or Bankruptcy. Upon the death, incompetence, bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, or dissolution of a Member, the rights and obligations of that Member under this Agreement shall accrue to that Member's successor(s), estate, or legal representative, and each such Person shall be treated as an unadmitted transferee of that Member's Tokens, as described in the Act.

**(b)** Limitation by Law. No provision of this Agreement shall be construed to provide for the indemnification for any liability to the extent (but only to the extent) that such indemnification would be in violation of applicable law, but instead shall be construed so as to effectuate the provisions thereof to the fullest extent permitted by law.

**(c)** Waiver of Fiduciary Duties. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or otherwise of applicable law, including any in equity or at law, no Member shall have any fiduciary duty to the DAO or to any Member by reason of this Agreement or in its capacity as a Member, except that the Members shall be subject to the implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing and the terms and provisions of this Agreement.
